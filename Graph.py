# graph is composed of sets and edges denoted by ----------G(E,V)
# Edges ------ lines
# vertices/nodes ----- points

Null Graph --      no edges is called null graph
trival graph  --   graph having only one vertices

undirected graph and directed graph   ---- edges do not have direction  is undiredcted
                                           edges which have proper direction is directed


connected and unconnected       ----      from one node we can visit another node is call connected
                                          we cannot visit another nodes is called unconmnected

regualr graph and complete graph ---      regular in which every vertex is equal to other vertex
                                          we can visit any node from any node

cycle graph and cyclic graph    ----      graph have cycle in itself
                                          at least contains on graph

Directed acylic graph ------------------- a dircted graph that doesnot conatoin cycle
Bipartie grpah            --------        a graph in which vertex is divided into two sets



There are two ways to store graph
                                                                                    adding Edge        removing      intializing

Adjacency Matrix -------------------------- Stored in form of 2D matrix                  0(1)             0(1)           0(N*N)
Adjacency List   -------------------------- its like collection of linked list           0(1)             0(N)           0(N)
